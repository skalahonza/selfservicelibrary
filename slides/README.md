# How to present

## Max 5 min
Your presentations must be crisp and quick, to accommodate all and leave some space for discussion the maximum duration of a presentation is 5 min, plus 5 min for questions.

## Your web page will be your presentation
Start with the essay. It should be a high-level description. Prepare the presentation on your project home page, since the Internet is the pervasive media, it is the best way how to discuss and cooperate. It is also where you get a global presence. The presentation may be one or more pages long. It can be plain text, but a 2 min movie sometimes tells more than a long article. 

## Your Web page hosting
You can use any technology and hosting. We will publish links to your presentation on VIA pages. If you choose other media then the web project home page, such as PowerPoint, have ready a copy and paste the link to your website so as any visitor can view it online.  

## Web page formatting
It can have an elementary form. Most important is the content.

## Use English 
English is preferable because we would like to attract students also from abroad and make your work visible.

## Presentation content
* Your presentation should answer these questions:
* What problem are you solving? 
* Why is your idea unique? 
* What are the steps to achieve your goals?
* Your customers are students, how large is the target audience?
* Quantify benefits of your product (cheaper, faster, other product improvements) 
* Who are the competitors? Why are you better?
